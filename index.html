					<p class="texthome"> <br> Rules of conduct - a rather relative thing. What is considered indecent in one
						country, completely normal in another, and vice versa. There is a Korean word for "ejol", translated into
						Russian as "good breeding, politeness, culture." But these words do not fully convey the meaning of this
						concept. Even Koreans understand “ejol” differently. It is difficult to define it in one word, because it
						expresses national tradition and customs. <p>

							<h2 class="homecom"> Korean communication </h2> <br>
							<p class="texthome"> As in any Asian country, Koreans bow very much: when they greet or say goodbye, ask
								for a favor, thank you for something or express their respect. It is necessary to treat seniors with
								respect, not to interrupt. Junior always bows first. The depth of the bow is determined by the
								difference in the status of the interlocutors: the larger it is, the lower the slope of the younger one
								and vice versa. If the social status of the interlocutor is high, special respect is expressed by a bow
								to the floor. Also in Korea, handshakes are widespread. The first is the one who surpasses social

								Koreans always want to get results, so they will not beat around the bush for a long time, but prefer to
								immediately begin to discuss the terms of the deal. They form a position clearly, but they will not try
								to prove to the interlocutor that he is wrong. You should not use phrases such as "we need time to
								think." It will be perceived as if you are absolutely not satisfied with the proposed conditions.
								Communication with potential partners should be arranged according to their status. Treat elders with
								the utmost respect, respect the hierarchy. If you do not show respect, a Korean may consider it your
								unwillingness to negotiate with him...</p>

							<h2 class="homecom"> Korean feast </h2> <br>
							<p class="texthome"> In the Republic, they most often eat sitting on the floor on special pillows. For
								serving dishes, small low tables are used where the dishes are placed. Before the start of the meal, it
								is customary to serve the guests a hot, wet towel that wipes their hands. Then the owner puts dishes
								with food, seasonings. There are certain rules that should be followed during the feast ...</p>
